# RSC+ replay sleepwords
These archives include all sleepwords present in the entire RSC+ Replay repositories found at 
https://github.com/RSCPlus/rscplus-replays and https://github.com/RSCPlus/rscplus-supplemental-replays

The RLE folder contains the images in their original Run Length Encoding custom format as sent on-wire from the official RSC servers.
The PNG folder contains the images as converted to PNG.

* File names of properly typed sleepwords are of the format "`sleep_[correct guess]_[replay file name]_[number of sleepwords encountered so far in the playsession]`"
* File names of incorrect sleepword guesses are of the format "`sleep_!INCORRECT![incorrect guess]_[replay file name]_[number of sleepwords encountered so far in the playsession]`"
* File names of otherwise unsuccessful sleepword challenges are of the format "`sleep_[!SUDDENLY-AWOKE! / !LOGGED-OUT!]_[replay file name]_[number of sleepwords encountered so far in the playsession]`"

A mapping of suspected correct guesses to their filenames may be uploaded in the future. There are approximately 5000 correctly identified sleepwords and 3000 unidentified sleepwords in this archive.

This data was scraped from replays automatically using the tool RSC- (https://github.com/RSCPlus/rscminus).
